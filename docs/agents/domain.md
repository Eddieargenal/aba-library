# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

**Layout: single-context.** One `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. `aba-library` is one system with one shared vocabulary — `source`, `finding`, `concept`, `retrieval_status`, `lifecycle_stage` span the tooling (`scripts/`), the knowledge layer (`wiki/`), and governance. Neither `CONTEXT.md` nor `docs/adr/` exists yet; they are created lazily by `/grill-with-docs` as terms and decisions get resolved.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   ├── adr/
│   │   ├── 0001-....md
│   │   └── 0002-....md
│   └── agents/        ← this setup (issue-tracker, triage-labels, domain)
├── scripts/           ← index/lint/sync tooling
├── wiki/              ← canonical knowledge (markdown + frontmatter)
└── governance/        ← schema, lint policy, review gates, prompts
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (...) — but worth reopening because…_
